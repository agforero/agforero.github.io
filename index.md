### Seminar at Argonne:
[![My Talk at Argonne](ioytthumb.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNEwXP_pYqg "My Talk at Argonne")


### About me:
Hey there! My name is Agustin, and I am a Master of Engineering in Computer Science student at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), the Cornell University campus in New York City. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and History from [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/), class of 2021. Originally from the town of Naperville, Illinois, I am an avid software engineer, working with several different languages and skills for the projects in which I involve myself. So far, I have experience in the following languages:

* C/C++
* Python
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Bash
* GNU Make
* Fortran
* Intel/ARM Assembly
* HTML5/CSS

During the summer of 2020, I interned at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov) as a Research Aide at the [Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/). I worked alongside two computational scientists to build tools for researching bleeding-edge compilers and supercomputing technologies. 

Then, from December 2020 to January 2021, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department to run graph analysis on interactions between human proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. I developed [a GUI suite based in Tkinter](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis) that makes it easy to generate a graph of connections stemming from a specific protein.

During my time at St. Olaf, I was appointed Chief Technology Officer of the Student Government Association, where I used Wix to develop [a new website for SGA](https://www.oleville.com/) from the ground up. I spent 6 semesters at the College grading, tutoring, and [teaching](https://github.com/agforero/SI-PLANNING) the introductory Python course, Principles of Computer Science ([CS121](https://wp.stolaf.edu/cs/listing-of-cs-courses/#CS1)). As a senior, my [Capstone](https://github.com/agforero/Capstone-2020) was a research project investigating the importance of collaboration in the development of tools that teach graph traversal algorithms.

Now, I attend Cornell Tech in New York City, working to complete my Master of Engineering in Computer Science. I am set to graduate in May of 2022. Thereafter, I will begin working as a Software Engineer at [InterSystems Corporation](https://www.intersystems.com/), located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I look forward to beginning my professional career within their Solutions Development Program.

### Projects:
#### Argonne National Laboratory:
* [Fortran Testing Framework](https://github.com/agforero/FTFramework): a collection of Python and Bash scripts to enable easy testing of Fortran compilers using [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).
* [nSTREAM](https://github.com/agforero/nSTREAM/): a fork of [STREAM](https://github.com/jeffhammond/STREAM) meant to benchmark and visualize the memory bandwidth of a supercomputer. Utilizes OpenMP.

#### University of Wisconsin-Madison:
* [Protein Analysis Tool](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis): a Tkinter-based GUI that helps UW-Madison virologists generate graphs of proteins important in the SARS-CoV-2 infection process.
* [Protein Clustering Heatmap](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/Heatmap): using a binary sorting algorithm, this Seaborn-based heatmap clusters proteins together based on their presence in different combinations of studies, cell lines and timestamps. Allows biologists to visualize groups of proteins with similar significance in studies. *(Seriously, the sorting algorithm is pretty cool, and I came up with it myself; even if someone has done something similar before, you should check out the [README](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/blob/main/code/Heatmap/README.md#how-clusters-are-arranged) to see how it works).*

#### St. Olaf College:
* [Oleville.com](https://www.oleville.com/): a rework of the St. Olaf Student Government Association's website, done on Wix.
* [OleGraph](https://github.com/agforero/Capstone-2020): the Capstone project for my senior year, investigating the application of collaboration in graph traversal algorithm teaching tools.
* [SI-PLANNING](https://github.com/agforero/SI-PLANNING/): a repo holding all my TA lesson plans from the spring of 2020.

#### Independent:
* [TMinesweeper](https://github.com/agforero/TMinesweeper/): a terminal-based Minesweeper game, coded in C++.
* [chain](https://github.com/agforero/chain): a heterogeneous, amendable data structure for C++. (WIP)

### More about me:
Ever since I was little, I've had two passions: computer science and history. My love for software grew from experimenting on  our old, beat-up Windows XP tower. Sure, my mom didn't love it when I downloaded German viruses and explored `System32`, but what else was I supposed to do without that shady copy of *Polar Bowler*? 

I've also had a ceaseless interest in the world of history and political science. Games like *Civilization III* certainly helped propel that forward, where I spent half of my time reading the *Civilopedia* instead of actually playing the game. Now, it's games like *Europa Universalis IV* and *Civilization* that continue to bring my love of history to the screen.

I have a great appreciation for the creation of patterns, the efficiency of algorithms and the conciseness of operations. I have always held 4X games dear for their ability to elegantly envelop users in an intricate world of strategy based around real-life nations and figureheads. Whether it's in the field of history or not, I hope to one day create software that is widely applicable, easily understood, and readily adaptable.

### Some other fun facts about me!

* I'm Greek and Colombian. You'll probably never meet another Greek Colombian in your life, unless you meet my siblings. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´
* I'm really into birdwatching. My favorite species of bird is the Black-Capped Chickadee. 
* Birdwatching also intersects with my interest in photography. My photograph of a bufflehead duck in Chelan, Washington [was featured in the St. Olaf Magazine](https://wp.stolaf.edu/magazine/files/2019/07/St-Olaf-Magazine_SpringSummer-2019.pdf#page=27)! Scroll down all the way to see it.
* I have a big rock collection. I've been collecting it since I was 6 or something.
* I can sing kinda well. I've been trying to make music lately. Might release something soon.
