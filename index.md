### Seminar at Argonne:

### About me:
Hey there! My name is Agustin, and I am a Master of Engineering in Computer Science student at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), the Cornell University campus in New York City. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and History from [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/), class of 2021. Originally from the town of Naperville, Illinois, I am an avid software designer, working with several different languages and skills for the projects I involve myself in. So far, I have experience in the following languages:

* C/C++
* Python
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Bash
* GNU Make
* FORTRAN
* Intel/ARM Assembly
* HTML5/CSS

During the summer of 2020, I interned at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov) as a Research Aide at the [Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/). I worked alongside two computational scientists to build tools for researching bleeding-edge compilers and supercomputing technologies. 

Then, from December 2020 to January 2021, I worked as a Research Assistant at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Department to run graph analysis on interactions between human proteins and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. I developed [a GUI suite based in Tkinter](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis) that makes it easy to generate a graph of connections stemming from a specific protein.

During my time at St. Olaf, I was appointed Chief Technology Officer of the Student Government Association, where I used Wix to develop [a new website for SGA](https://www.oleville.com/) from the ground up. I spent 6 semesters at the College grading, tutoring, and [teaching](https://github.com/agforero/SI-PLANNING) the introductory Python course, Principles of Computer Science (CS 121). As a senior, my [Capstone](https://github.com/agforero/Capstone-2020) was a research project investigating the importance of collaboration in the development of tools that teach graph traversal algorithms.

### Projects:
#### Argonne National Laboratory:
* [Fortran Testing Framework](https://github.com/agforero/FTFramework): a collection of Python and Bash scripts to enable easy testing of Fortran compilers using [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).
* [nSTREAM](https://github.com/agforero/nSTREAM/): a fork of [STREAM](https://github.com/jeffhammond/STREAM) meant to benchmark and visualize the memory bandwidth of a supercomputer. Utilizes OpenMP.

#### University of Wisconsin-Madison:
* [Protein Analysis Tool](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis): a Tkinter-based GUI that helps UW-Madison virologists generate graphs of proteins important in the SARS-CoV-2 infection process.
* [Protein Clustering Heatmap](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/Heatmap): using a binary sorting algorithm, this Seaborn-based heatmap clusters proteins together based on their presence in different combinations of studies, cell lines and timestamps. Allows biologists to find visually find groups of proteins with similar significance in studies. *(Seriously, the sorting algorithm is pretty cool, and I came up with it myself; even if someone has done something similar before, you should check out the [README](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/blob/main/code/Heatmap/README.md#how-clusters-are-arranged) to see how it works).*

#### St. Olaf College:
* [Oleville.com](https://www.oleville.com/): a rework of the St. Olaf Student Government Association's website, done on Wix.
* [OleGraph](https://github.com/agforero/Capstone-2020): the Capstone project for my senior year, investigating the application of collaboration in graph traversal algorithm teaching tools.
* [SI-PLANNING](https://github.com/agforero/SI-PLANNING/): a repo holding all my TA lesson plans from the spring of 2020.

#### Independent:
* [TMinesweeper](https://github.com/agforero/TMinesweeper/): a terminal-based Minesweeper game, coded in C++.
* [chain](https://github.com/agforero/chain): a heterogeneous, amendable data structure for C++. (WIP)

### More about me:
Ever since I was little, I've had two passions: computer science and history. My love for software grew from experimenting on  our old, beat-up Windows XP tower. Sure, my mom didn't love it when I downloaded German viruses and explored `System32`, but what else was I supposed to do without that shady copy of *Polar Bowler*? 

I've also had a ceaseless interest in the world of history and political science. Games like *Civilization III* certainly helped propel that forward, where I spent half of my time reading the *Civilopedia* instead of actually playing the game. Now, it's games like *Europa Universalis IV* and *Civilization* that continue to bring my love of history to the screen.

I have a great appreciation for the creation of patterns, the efficiency of algorithms and the conciseness of operations. I have always held 4X games dear for their ability to elegantly envelop users in an intricate world of strategy based around real-life nations and figureheads. Whether it's in the field of history or not, I hope to one day create software that is widely applicable, easily understood, and readily adaptable.
